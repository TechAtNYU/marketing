# Workflow

**Main event planner / Initiative lead** will be referred in this doc as "Techey"

### 1. Preparation

As much lead time as possible before the event, 2 weeks sounds ideal

1. Techey figures out the details of their event and what they require from Marketing
2. Techey fills out the [Creative Brief](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fMny8cb3APT8g9joTy34zQ1EwI8adsAV1_QOgpUGImE/). Remember to include the following in the Brief, if applicable:
  - prerequisites
  - exactly what they will make
  - what they should install in advance and how
  - how get into the building
  - wifi credentials for non-NYU
  - where and how to RSVP beforehand
3. Marketing will send back any assets and guidance requested in the Creative Brief and asks for Techey's approval
4. Techey approves or makes any requests for changes via email
5. In the event that Techey does not respond, Marketing will send 1 follow up email. Failure to respond to this email will result in Marketing deciding what to do at their discretion (most likely go ahead)

### 2. Online

1. Marketing will take the approved Creative Brief and input the data into the API via Intranet
2. Marketing will then make a Facebook event with the data from the Intranet and will let the e-board know (via Slack?)
3. **Everyone on Tech@NYU is responsible for inviting friends on the FB event**. (TBD - whether or not Marketing has further strategy/best practices on inviting?)
4. Marketing will post on other forms of Social Media (this is TBD)
5. Marketing will work on the Newsletter copy and sendout

### 3. IRL

1. Marketing will coordinate the production of any flyers or other IRL advertising
2. Marketing will speak with the appropriate NYU and/or NYC governing bodies in order to post the adverts
3. Marketing will get the advertising made with enough notice (timeframe TBD) and tell the original team (Techey's team) that the ads are ready to be distributed
4. Techey and Techey's team will put up the advertising in the appropriate locations as determined by 3.2 above

### 4. Days before the Event

1. TBD - but probably Marketing will do some social media reminders

### 5. After the Event

1. Infrastructure Feedback will route Feedback to the Marketing team
2. Marketing will analyze the Feedback to research and understand what members actually want out of our events
